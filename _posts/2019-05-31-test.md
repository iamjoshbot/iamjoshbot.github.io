Django provides some fantastic helpers for handling user authentication, password resets and changes.

Upon implementing password reset functionality I found a small part of the built in PasswordResetConfirmView that I wasn't happy with. The default email sent to a user to reset their password contains a url linking to the password reset page. This url, whilst adequately secure, contains the base64 encoded id of the given user.

The problem with showing this id to the user is:

* It reveals to the user how many other users your site may have. (If their id is 350, they can guess you have at least 350 users)
* It provides to the user the primary key of their user account in the database which could aid in the exploitation of Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).


## Solution

Most Django based websites handling user signups will probably need a custom user model.

My preferred method is to add a seperate Profile model automatically created/updated with the built-in User model.
See an example models.py below which creates manages this extended user profile. It also provides an account_id field which we can use to improve the built in password reset method.

#### models.py

```python
import uuid
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.dispatch import receiver


class Profile(models.Model):
  user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
  account_id = models.UUIDField(unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4)


@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)


@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def save_user_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.profile.save()
```

#### CustomPasswordResetConfirmView.py

```python
from django.contrib.auth.views import PasswordResetConfirmView
from django.utils.encoding import force_bytes
from django.utils.http import urlsafe_base64_encode

# Change to match location of your models file
from app.models import Profile


class CustomPasswordResetConfirmView(PasswordResetConfirmView):
    def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            profile = Profile.objects.get(account_id=kwargs['uidb64'])
            kwargs['uidb64'] = urlsafe_base64_encode(force_bytes(profile.user.pk))
            return super(CustomPasswordResetConfirmView, self).dispatch(*args, **kwargs)
        except:
            return super(CustomPasswordResetConfirmView, self).dispatch(*args, **kwargs)
```

#### urls.py

```python
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

from django.contrib.auth.views import (
    PasswordResetView,
    PasswordResetDoneView,
    PasswordResetCompleteView
)
# Change to point to real location
from views import CustomPasswordResetConfirmView

urlpatterns = [
    
    # Forgotten Password Page
    url(r'^accounts/password_reset/$', PasswordResetView.as_view(template_name='password_reset_form.html'), name='password_reset'),

    # Page shown after a user has been emailed a password reset link
    url(r'^accounts/password_reset/done/$', PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(template_name='password_reset_done.html'), name='password_reset_done'),

    # Form shown for entering a new password
    url(r'^accounts/reset/(?P<uidb64>[0-9A-Za-z_\-]+)/(?P<token>[0-9A-Za-z]{1,13}-[0-9A-Za-z]{1,20})/$',
        CustomPasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(
            post_reset_login=False,
            template_name='password_reset_confirm.html'
        ),
        name='password_reset_confirm'
    ),

    # Page showing user that password has been changed successfully
    url(r'^accounts/reset/done/$', PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(template_name='password_reset_complete.html'), name='password_reset_complete'),

]
```
