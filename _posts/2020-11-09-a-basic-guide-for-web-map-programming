## Definitions of terms

### Ellipsoid
In basic terms: An ellipsoid is a deformed (squashed/non perfect) sphere.

### Mercator Projection
The Mercator Projection is a projection (or design of of map) that is used to display a spherical object (the Earth) onto a flat surface (a 2D map).

### Web Mercator Projection
The Mercator Projection, but warped slightly for the purposes of web mapping.

### WGS84
WGS stands for World Geodetic System, (WGS)84 is the latest revision of this system (made in 1984).
In basic terms: WGS84 defines the coordinate system used to map the earth.

### SRID
Spacial Reference System Identifier
In basic terms: A unique identifier used to define a spacial coordinate system

### EPSG
EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is a registry/log og spacial reference systems, ellipsoids and datums


## Which codes are for what

### EPSG:4326
The unique identifier used to reference WGS84

### EPSG:3857
The identifier used to reference the Web Mercator Projection
**EPSG:3857 used to be known as: EPSG:900913 and EPSG:3785 (among other less common identifiers).**

### EPSG:4326 vs SRID:4326
For the purposes of what we need to know, these are the same thing.


## Making sense of the jargon
When storing geospacial information in a database to display on a web-based map, you will need to be aware of which reference system your coordinates are based on and the map will be displayed in.

Most coordinates used on the web and look something like this: 51.464794, 0.258937 (these point to the QE II Bridge).
These coordinates are typically based on a coordinate reference system that uses the WGS84 datum, AKA EPSG:4326.
